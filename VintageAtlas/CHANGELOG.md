### Architecture Improvements

- Separated web server logic into `WebServer`, `RequestRouter`, and controllers

  - `VintageAtlas.Core` - Configuration and interfaces
  - `VintageAtlas.Models` - Data models
  - `VintageAtlas.Export` - Map generation
  - `VintageAtlas.Tracking` - Historical data
  - `VintageAtlas.Web.Server` - HTTP infrastructure
  - `VintageAtlas.Web.API` - REST controllers
  - `VintageAtlas.Commands` - Chat commands

### Technical Details

- Zero warnings, clean compilation

### Migration from WebCartographer

If migrating from WebCartographer:

1. Remove old `webcartographer` mod
2. Install `vintageatlas` mod
3. Rename `WebCartographerConfig.json` to `VintageAtlasConfig.json`
4. Update any scripts/integrations to use new API endpoints
5. Update command usage from `/webc` to `/va`

All data formats remain compatible - existing maps and historical data will work seamlessly.
